Prepare a 5 minute pitch presenting your project. Note that there will be 2 minute question session after.

You may use 3-5 slides – no more, no less.

Your pitch must include:

- Brief Introduction: topic, relevant course unit(s), the main phenomena you aim to study.

- Research question(s), hypotheses, and/or conjectures - and how will plan to test them. Keep it short and concise.

- Experiments you intend to run (in brief).

- Potential benefit(s) and possible pitfall(s): What’s nice about your project if it works? When or why would you expect it not to work?

Guidelines:

- Base you presentation on your answers to the questions in the questionnaire (remember it needs to be submitted before presentation day).

- As always, we expect you to present clear and deep thinking. Your presentation should convey a clear plan for the upcoming project.

- The primary goal of this presentations session is to help you focus – your presentation should be minimal and precise. This is hard when time is short. We will strictly enforce the 7 min timeslots, so make sure to time yourselves at home.

- The second goal is for you to get (as presenters) and give (as listeners) constructive feedback. The more focuses and clear your presentation is, the easier it will be for us to provide feedback that is useful.

- As most of you may have noticed, forming a coherent project requires making lots of choices, which can be hard. But to have a coherent presentation, some choices must be made (this is actually our goal for the session). Choices are non-committing (meaning that, given good reason, you can change your mind later on) – but don’t be surprised if you don’t (hint: endowment bias).
